## instructions

Weigh out 0.3 g of licodaine HCL powder. Add the powder to a 15 ml vial of saline solution. Place the vial in tap water and heat it past 80 C and keep it at that temperature for 2--3 minutes. The powder melts and dissolves at 80 C in water. Allowing the powder to melt, not just dissolve, in the water ensures even distribution with low chance of particulates. If particulates remain after melting, they are not lidocaine HCL and the solution shouldn't be used.

This procedure results in a 15 ml vial of 2 % w/v lidocaine HCL for use, which is about the maximum recommended safe dosage for an adult human. The solution should be used within about 24 hours with leftover solution discarded because it doesn't contain preservatives or antibacterials.

To reduce the concentration, the formula is as follows:

weight of lidocaine in g / volume of saline solution in ml * 100

For example, 1 g lidocaine / 100 ml of saline solution * 100 = 0.01 * 100 = 1 % solution.

After injection, the full effect is reached in about 10 minutes and lasts a little over 30 minutes before wearing off quickly.
