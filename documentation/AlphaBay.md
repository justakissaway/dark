# AlphaBay (darknet market -- now closed)

## guide

- PGP
    - Generate ASCII-armoured [PGP](#PGP) keys.
- Bitcoin
    - Set up a wallet private key and public key, perhaps using [vanitygen](#vanity-wallet).
    - Generate QR codes for the keys using [pyqrcode](#QR-code).
    - Perhaps while on a VPN connection on Android, import the wallet into [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet).
        - Select Accounts.
        - Select the key+ icon.
        - Select Advanced.
        - Select Scan.
        - Scan the public wallet address QR code.
        - Select the key+ icon.
        - Select Advanced.
        - Select Scan.
        - Scan the private wallet key QR code.
    - If needed, buy on LocalBitcoins.
- Access VPN (e.g. [AirVPN](https://github.com/wdbm/resources_AirVPN), [IPVanish](https://www.ipvanish.com)).
- Access Tor.
- Access [AlphaBay](http://pwoah7foa6au2pul.onion/index.php).
- Add PGP information to AlphaBay profile.
- Select product from vendor with high number of positive reviews and reputation on forums and on the AlphaBay subreddit.
- Move Bitcoin to AlphaBay wallet, perhaps using a plausible deniability wallet or Bitcoin tumbling, though AlphaBay now features Bitcoin tumbling. Move a little more than is needed because of Bitcoin price shifts.
- Enter the product amount and the delivery address. *Always* encrypt the mailing information and communications.
- After purchase, there should be a window of the order status. Check on the autocomplete option from time to time and inform the vendor to prolong it in case the order has not arrived yet.
- After the order has arrived and been verified, finalise the payment as soon as possible. The vendor cannot take the Bitcoin unless the buyer allows the vendor to do so.
- For extra security, perhaps change Bitcoin wallets.
- Review the vendor.
