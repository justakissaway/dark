1. Amendment 1 Tor Router from CognitiveMetropolis.
Plug it in, change the wifi name and password, restart and connect.
This Wifi hotspot sends all your data over Tor network.

2. Libreboot x200 Laptop
Has a Libre BIOS, and disabled a the Intel management engine and AMD SPS CPU backdoors.
get them on minifree.org

3. Use Trisquel OS or Tails OS, or Qubes/Whonix OS.
Trisquel OS is my daily, main OS, I have added GUFW firewall, settings incoming deny, outgoing allowed.
Tails is good because it doesnt store history.
Qubes/Whonix has sandboxing so thats good.

4. Tor Browser OBFS4 Secturity slider to Safest.
Launch Tor, go to bridges.torproject.org and get like 10 OBFS4 bridges.
Then GEOLOCATE the IP until you find a bridge located in a non-14 eyes, non-Nato country. I like bridges in places like Lithuania, Latvia, Austria. (All non nato/non 14 eyes)
Click the shield in Tor Browser, and set security to Safest, highest security.
Click the URL bar, type about:config
set the values as:
java
javascript.enabled = false

webgl
webgl.disabled = true

5. Exclude the 14 eyes countries in the torrc file, within the Tor Browser folder.
Open Tor Browser folder > Browser > Tor Browser > Data > Tor open torrc in text editor.

Add this line below everything:
ExcludeNodes {us},{uk},{gb},{de},{au},{il},{jp},{sg},{nl},{nz},{ca},{fr},{es},{se},{ch},{ir},{lu},{be},{it},{mx},{dk},{no},{hk},{kr},{kp},{tw},{th},{ua},{tr},{??},{pt},{ie},{ru},{ro}

Save the file, and restart Tor.


Your Tor Browser should now be using an offshore, non 14 eyes OBFS4 bridge, such as a bridge to Austria.

your security shield is set to :Safest, webgl and javascript are disabled via about:config, and your nodes are avoiding 14 eyes and most nato countries.

Now, visit dark.fail to get your links, and shop on Cryptonia (the best market, most secure, support answers within 24 hours)


Always use PGP to encrypt your address.
PGP safesguards your address so only the vendor can open it.

If your on Linux Trisquel OS, Debian etc, Download GPA.
If using Tails, is the clipboard app.

If on Windows GPG4USB
If on Mac, try GPA if aviable.


Only save the market username:password in an encrypted textfile. Dont store the URL, market name etc.
I reccomend create a small (50 megabyte) VeraCrypt container, and inside the encrypted container, create a text file with a common word market login such as:
BlueGreenBicycle2
6932959129593286832841824jgsajgi.,Bb"keyboard

Just store ^ that for example, a Cryptonia market login. Dont write 'Cryptonia' or add the URL.

Just the username:password. So that if someone finds the User:password, they dont know which website its for.


-
Once your pack arrives, use a permanant market to black out the sender, tracking code, and receipient name/address. then burn or dispose in public trashcan.

As for your received product, I reccomend you bury it, 4 feet underground, on a friends property, your property, or somewhere totally abandoned where literally nobody will see you or you place.
I personally only buy mushrooms, so drug dogs cant detect them. So I'd be fine to bury my mushrooms on my property or my friends.

But if your burying vaccume sealed weed, or anything else which drug dogs can detect, I reccomend the buried in the forest technique.

And for your cell phone, never use Wikr, its closed source.
Never do anything illigal with a cell phone, they are all backdoored and hacked.
Phones are a top priority target for hacking via intelligence agencies since they contain all your contacts, can record every tap on the phone keyboard you make even if you dont send a message, can view you via camera, record your voice and do automated voice-to-text keyword analysis, stingray your phone and implant firmware based malware, cell tower triangulation, cellebrite.. point is keep your phone clean.


And finially, never speak about the darknet in real life. Talking about Tor is fine, but if your buying on the darknet to resell to people in person, never reveal your source.
