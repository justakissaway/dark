- "Mushrooms. This does not apply to everyone, but after my first trip I noticed a distinct change in my psyche. After I sobered up I realized that a lot of my insecurities weren't gone, but were significantly diminished. It's hard to put into words, but I came out of it feeling like I was better oriented to the world around me. It felt like hitting the reset button on my brain." -- [reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4ftjvk/what_is_your_1010_would_recommend_experience/d2btja5)

- "Do it once every 6 months. The term I would use is "clean slate". It's like you allow yourself to have a fresh start on life again, kinda realigns your life path. Definitely be in the right mind set, good company and timing is everything. Don't be afraid, just embrace that shit, it's not scary. 11/10, can't wait to trip again." -- [reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4ftjvk/what_is_your_1010_would_recommend_experience/d2by7nx)

- "I was a doctor that was on rotation in the emergency department. 33 year old male who was brought in naked by the police, under the influence of suspected mushroom ingestion. He had a bit of trouble understanding ‘why’ he’d been arrested, despite being very aware of the fact that he’d been caught galavanting around naked in the rain in a children’s playground.

The initial police response had been with two officers, and he told me with glee that they weren’t able to grab him because he was ‘slippery like an oiled pig’ in the rain, and the nakedness didn’t help with no clothing for them to grab. Due to being unable to catch him, they called for dog-squad backup. He recounted with a shit-eating grin how he’d hidden inside a giant puddle ‘like Rambo’ and had thrown sticks and rocks to confuse the police dog. Following an hour or so, they gave up and reverted to using a search line of ~12 police slowly advancing to find him. Eventually one stumbled into this goblin’s little swamp puddle, and then they took another 15 minutes trying to catch him as he bolted naked around the children’s playground...again.

His only regret, despite his wife refusing to come and pick him up from the hospital, was that he hadn’t eaten more shrooms.

Edit: I’m glad this story is brightening a few days. Thank you for the silvers and golds! To his fans: I’m sure he’s somewhere out there to this very day...naked, slippery, and plotting his revenge...

Edit 2: It's a big no-no, I know-know, but I couldn't resist. I remembered that I took a screenshot of his "presenting complaint" when he came into the ED - I needed something to show my future children. Don't worry, all identifiable information has safely been removed Slippery, naked silliness
. Also, fixed the Dr Who - a lot of concerned BBC fans out there..." -- [reference](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bmhq67/in_honor_of_denvers_decriminalization_of_magic/emx2rj5)
