# introduction

Amphetamine (speed, Adderall) is a semipotent stimulant. Methamphetamine is an amphetamine molecule with an extra methyl group which gives it the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently and, in turn, makes it much more potent than regular amphetamine. MDMA (methyldioxymethamphetamine) and MDA (methyldioxyamphetamine)) are designer amphetamines with stimulant and mild hallucinogenic properties.

# caution

```
When Little Timmy took an 'E'
to while away the night:
"I barely felt a *thing*", said he,
and spoke, "This can't be right."

He waited half a second's span --
a moment more, or two --
and when, at last, the next began,
he wondered what to do.

"Perhaps it takes a *few* before
it settles in" he sighed,
so Timmy swallowed sixty more

and Timmy fucking died.
