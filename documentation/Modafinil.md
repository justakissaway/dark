# Modafinil

# guide

- Make a list of things to do in order to avoid focusing on distractions.
- The halflife of Modafinil is ~15 hours. So, taking 100 mg at 05:00 is likely to result in ~50 mg being present at 20:00, which should still be psychologically detectable.
- Modafinil runs on water. Take lots of water for good effect. Caffine can be complementary to Modafinil.
- A tolerance to Modafinil can build if it is used over consecutive days. Perhaps once per week or once per month results in something approaching optimal efficacy.

# Armodafinil

Armodafinil is basically an enantiopure form of Modafinil. Specifically, it contains largely only one optical isomer (chiral form) of Modafinil that is theoretically the effective one.
