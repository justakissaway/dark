# guidance if caught

- [Drug possession offences: A guide to help you represent yourself -- Release](https://www.release.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/publications/Self%20rep%20final%20edit%20PLAIN%20ENGLISH.pdf)

"If you are in possession of a controlled drug but honestly believe it is something that you can lawfully possess, you might have a defence. For example, you are caught in possession of cocaine, but honestly believed it was a novel psychoactive substance (‘NPS’), sometimes called a ‘legal high’. These are actually now controlled under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, but possession isn’t an offence. You will need to give some evidence of this -- for example if you bought it online and can prove what it was sold as through emails. But, be careful as importing NPS for personal use is an offence, so if it comes from abroad, you will be admitting that you are guilty of this offence."

- ["But I thought it was a nootropic, I thought it was Modafinial in powder form. I am thankful for guidance that will ensure that this never again happens. Look, here is the Dream webpage that shows that I bought this and that it was advertised as a nootropic."](https://t3e6ly3uoif4zcw2.onion/help#VendorsGuideline)

"It is also a defence if you can prove that you were going to destroy the drugs or give them to someone who was allowed to possess them, as soon as possible. For example, if you are a parent who took some drugs from your child and were going to destroy them but were caught by police before you could do that. Or, if you’re a bouncer at a club and take drugs from someone and you are planning to take them to the police and are caught in possession on the way to the station."
